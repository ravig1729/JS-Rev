    <h1>"setTimeout function ,
        Event loop and callback queue,
        callback function , callback hell"</h1>
    
    <pre>setTimeout Function:It is a type of function whenever we want to run it at certain time intervals i.e whenever 
        we want to delay our function after certain time then we will use setTimeoutFunction
        </pre>

    <pre> An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty. The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded.</pre>

    <pre>Callback queue: Call back queue or message queue contains the list of messages to be processed and their associated call back functions</pre>
